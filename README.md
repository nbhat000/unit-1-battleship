# Battleship

## Rules of the Game
Battleship is a tactical strategy game. This version is 1-player. The objective of the game is to find your enemy's ships and blow them up before a maximum number of misses is reached. The ships are placed and hidden before the round begins, and then the player has 10 tries to reveal their positions. A square turning dark blue signifies a miss, and a square turning dark red signifies a hit.
